== Description ==
Displays at QR code dynaically on a page or post with URL to that page/post. 

There are many QR generators that are avialable for use. Most of these, however, are accessbile via the admin dashboard so you can create site QR codes as media files for download. This plugin also does that but goes one step further - it allows you to use shortcode to dynamically generate a QR code for the page or post being displayed.

*Wolfe Candy QR Code Generator* is part of the *Wolfe Candy* suite of plugins that all work together to make [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/ "Your favorite software") site creation that much easier. The QR code generator works particularly well with the *Wolfe Candy S3 Gallery*.

Major features include:

* This dynamically generates a QR code in the front-end for the page or post that is being displayed via shortcode.
* This plugin uses the standard PHP generator library so it can also generate a QR code to a file.
* It can also generate a QR code for any data text via shortcode.
* Alter size, error correction and pixel scale via shortcode arguments.
* It is a simple QR code generator so does not support different color styles and logos - it just does what is needs to do.

It is completely FREE - development and maintenance by the *Wolfe Candy* team headed by *Jrack Wolfe* is funded through [donations](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DY2RMD3J4SR3Q "Donate to Wolfe Candy") from generous users.
